Circular Linked List Insertion At Position
You are given a circular linked list of size N. You need to insert an element data just after the given position pos.
The position of first element is 1. If the given position is greater than N, then don't insert anything as it is not possible.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
(the first and last node is connected,
i.e. 0 --> 2)
position = 7,data = 99
Output: 2 4 6 7 5 1 0 99

Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
(the first and last node is connected,
i.e. 5 --> 1)
position = 6, element = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
